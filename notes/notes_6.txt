// Here we see how to create custom user model which will be used in our website

1. To get a clean slate we first go to src folder and delete the sqllite database file and inside the migrations folder
   we delete all the migrations(commits) includeing the initial one.
2. Then we run the server again to get the sqllite database file again.
3. Now we make a new app 'account' which will contain all the user accounts.
4. then we register this app in the settings.py file of mysite directory.
5. Now we will make our first custom user model which extends AbstractBaseUser. (check out the code).
   and we will override the varables and functions alredy defined in AbstractBaseUser class.
6. We also have to make a MyAccountManager Class which will extend from BaseUserManager. (check from code).
   This need to define two methods create_user, create_superuser.
7. Now that we have created our account user model, we need to specify it in the setting.py file so that
   the django can recognise that this new model is to be used for authentication.
   // for this we have to add in setting.py:
	AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'account.Account'
8. Then make the migrations and migrate ...
9. Now we again create a superuser to access the admin panel to see changes.
10.We also have to register this model in admin.py file in the account app.
11.Then run the server and see the changes.
12.After all of these, there are still issues that needs to be addressed like showing the passwrd in 
   the coded form and displying some more fields in the database where the users are listed.
13.These will be addressed in the next lesson.
