// In this lesson we'll see how to work with Admin panel and creating superuser 
1. The admin App is autogenerated by django while creating a project and its URL is 
	already there in the urls.py in the mysite directory.
2. First we run python manage.py migrate which is same as commiting chages to the database.
3. AFter that we run server and then add a new superuser to the admin app by command :
	python manage.py createsuperuser
4. Then go to the admin login and log in and check out the admin panel.
