// here we r gona deal with reusing html pages instead of making the new ones everytime
1. To reuse pages we make use of django content blocks.
// see the code for reference 
2. Now since we have added 'templates' as the keyword inside the mysite.setting.py file
   so Django will always try to find the html pages using the keyword 'tempalates' for 
   directory name.
3. So we add a new directory named templates inside the mixed app which will contain the pages which are 
   a part of mixed app.
4. So after we make the mixed_homepage.html which extends base.html, we need to put the same content block
   inside the base.html file so that it can know where to inser the code from the new file
5. Then as before we have to create a view for this html file
6. The view will be similar as for now only difference being the path which we will write as 'mixed/home.html'.
7. Next we have seen how to include snippets in the webpages so that we can use the same
   piece of code for different webpages which contain similar content.
