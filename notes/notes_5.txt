zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzxzzxzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzxxxxzxxx// In this lesson we read about the models in python which will be used for making tables
// please see the official documentation of python for list of all the model datafields
1.	Create a model. Also check out
	def __str__(self):
		return whateverTheFuckYouWantToPrintWhenTheObjectGetsPrinted

2.	Since the models are for creating a table in the database. We fist have to 
	create a table with that model using:
	python manage.py makemigrations

3.	Then we have to commit these changes to the database using:
	python manage.py migrate
4. 	For these changes to be reflected in the admin panel we need to add the model we 
	just created to the admin.py file anf then we have to register the table in the panel
	as follows:
	
	from mixed.models import Question	
	admin.site.register(Question)
5. 	Then run the server and check out the admin panel
