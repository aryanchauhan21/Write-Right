// Now we ll see how to pass data to templates through views

1.	we do this by passing a context as a dictionary with key-value pairs.
2.	Then we access this context by putting a Django block in the html code and 
	then getting the values using the keys like this...
	
insidde view{
	context = {}
	context['some_string'] = "yeah, man!!"
	return render(request, "htmlpage.html", context)
}

3.	And we access this context in the html file as
	
	{{some_string}}
4.	We can also send lists as the dictionary elements in the Context.
	And it can be accessed using a for loop block like
	{% for item in list %}
		{{item}}
	//here we are not writing print(item) because we dont want the item to be 
	  printed in the console.... and for HTML we just need to write the item 
	  name in the code.

5.	Another important feature is .... we can use Same snippet to display data
	in a particular format accross webpages or the same webpage, by calling the 
	snippets with arguments. For this we have to make snippets ... arguments
	arguments accepting.
	checkout the code.
